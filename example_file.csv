Stefani at a Colorado Springs Kaiser clinic. He offered a tetanus shot and he ended up telling the staff to give 2 additional vaccinations that I neither asked for or approved. After I complained he wrote on my record that he told me about these vaccinations and gave me a pamphlet explaining them. I asked for a simple apology and we could end this mistake. Instead this doctor falsified documents to justify his mistake.

I joined Kaiser 3 years ago but I have had health insurance through a regular PPO for the past 20 years.    The Kaiser system is so much faster and much less work going to specialist or getting urgent care like an X-ray or tests done.   The doctors are easy to communicate with by email.  The oncall nurse is super useful and sometimes eliminates a doctors visit.  My experience hasn’t been perfect but what system is.  Kaiser is pretty darn close to perfection.

The MAPMG Physician in Charge, Dr. Cheryl Keys, forced early retirement on a 65 year old surgeon 14 months short of his receiving full retirement benefits and his own family now has no health insurance; it was cheaper for Kaiser to hire a younger, less experienced doctor to replace him.
